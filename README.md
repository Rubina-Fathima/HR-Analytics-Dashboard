# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
The HR Analytics dashboard in Tableau is a comprehensive tool for exploring and analyzing data related to employee performance, satisfaction, and turnover. The dashboard features several interactive visualizations that enable HR professionals and managers to identify trends and patterns, and make informed decisions about their workforce.

The dashboard includes a series of tabs, each providing a different view of the data. The first tab presents an overview of key HR metrics, including headcount, turnover rate, and average employee tenure. Users can filter the data by department, location, or job level to get a more detailed view of the metrics.

The second tab presents a heatmap that shows the distribution of employee engagement scores across departments and job levels. Users can hover over each cell to see the engagement score and the number of employees in that category. This visualization can help HR managers identify departments or job levels with low engagement and take proactive steps to improve employee satisfaction.

The third tab presents a scatter plot that shows the relationship between employee satisfaction and performance. Users can filter the data by department, location, or job level to see how different groups of employees perform. This visualization can help managers identify high-performing employees who may be at risk of leaving due to low satisfaction.

The fourth tab presents a bar chart that shows the top reasons for employee turnover. Users can filter the data by department, location, or job level to see how different groups of employees are impacted by turnover. This visualization can help HR managers identify areas for improvement and develop retention strategies.

Overall, the HR Analytics dashboard in Tableau provides HR professionals and managers with a powerful tool for understanding and managing their workforce. The interactive visualizations and filtering options enable users to gain insights into employee performance, engagement, and turnover, and make data-driven decisions that improve employee satisfaction and retention
